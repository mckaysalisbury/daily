While you do have the rights to fork this (I can't retract that right, as I'm hosting in public
github, so that I can use github pages [aka github.io]), I claim that only gives you the right to
make a fork, and therefore look at the code. Take a look all you want. There isn't much code here.

Mostly, I want to keep these images mine. (admittedly, some of them contain the intellectual
property of others. I don't think they need to be shared. Hence this disclaimer.

However, my standard disclaimer disclaimer exists. If you think you want to make a derivative work
or use let me know, we can probably work out a deal.
