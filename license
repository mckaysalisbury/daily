While you do have the rights to fork this (I can't retract that right, as I'm hosting in public
github, so that I can use github pages [aka github.io]), I claim that only gives you the right to
make a fork, and therefore look at the code. Take a look all you want. There isn't much code here.

But I claim this intellectual property as my own. (admittedly, some of the *content* contains the intellectual
property of others. Which is part of the reason the caveat exists on the claim.)

However, my standard disclaimer disclaimer exists. If you think you want to make a derivative work
or use let me know, we can probably work out a deal.
