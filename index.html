        <h1>McKay's Daily Database</h1>
        <p>This is just a database of daily things.</p>

            I'm at least a little obsessive compulsive. I likes lists. I adopted the insult
            <a href="https://github.com/mckaysalisbury/ListBoy">ListBoy</a> as a moniker of sorts.

            I like to express myself with my shirts. It lets people know who I am. They're
            conversation starters, and they help me be a little more social than I might otherwise
            be. Some have expressed the desire to know what I'm wearing in days those are not near
            me, so I thought about making this database.

            When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I was working from home every day. A coworker of mine,
            Ken, left a stuffed animal on camera. I like to embrace fun, so I decided to adapt that
            and put a LEGO minifig in the camera. I thought I would change it up, and put a
            different one in every day. The pandemic lasted longer than I thought it would, so it
            seemed like minifigs were filling a lot of the same parts of my life that tshirts did
            pre-pandemic.
        </p>

            After I realized I was probably going to be working over a camera for a good portion of
            the remainder of my career, I thought about making such a list. Shortly after I was no
            longer at that company, I finally got the drive to actually make this database.
